Introduction
************
In July 2016, http://community.opensourcebeehives.net/ went down. In an attempt to make
the contents more easily accessible for anyone still interested, we tried to squeeze
things out of the wayback machine.

However, being driven by an ancient version of Discourse (Discourse 1.1.0.beta2),
some additional polishing was required. For details, have a look at the repository history.

Tweak the HTML tree into being coherent and self-contained, YMMV.
