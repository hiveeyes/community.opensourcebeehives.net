    <title>I have developed iPhone app named BeeHive</title>
    <link>http://community.opensourcebeehives.net/t/i-have-developed-iphone-app-named-beehive/299</link>
    <description>I am Yuichi, a beekeeper from Japan, and I live in San Francisco now.

I released an iPhone app for beekeepers. It is social networking app for beekeeper and allows you to communicate with beekeepers all over the world.

It would be great if you could install this app and try it. You can log in by using your Facebook Account.

You may wonder why I developed this app. I am working for a technology company as a Engineer, so I can develop apps by myself.My parents keep bees in Japan and I had kept them too in Japan.

This app is completely free and there are no ad. I would like many people to enjoy beekeeping more.
If many people like it, I would like to develop Android version.

And eventually, I wanna support Open Source Beehives in the future. 

You can download this app on App store.

App Store (Free download)
https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1043834217

And I have the landing page for this app.
