    <title>Production Price for BNC Warre Beehive</title>
    <link>http://community.opensourcebeehives.net/t/production-price-for-bnc-warre-beehive/229</link>
    <description>Hallo 
I am frustated. I wanted to produce a BNC Warre Beehive but the production in Switzerland (only CNC milling and wood) costs about 1800 $. Is this normal. 
What are the prices in other areas?

Thanks

              <p>Thanks for all the information.<br>I will try to find another production place because I want to produce some other things from the AKER project as well. <br>But if production is the same range you do not have any chance to bring this products to the crowd.<br>A finished Warre hive including glas and everything delivered by post costs about 250.- CHF.<br>This has to be the range we should end up,. <br>Otherwise it does not make much sense to produce simple things with expensive machines and high technology</p>

              <p>Yes the price seems WAY over the top - I would look into doing it somewhere else.</p>

<p>The only reason I can imaging this shop justifying this charge is that they'll need to spend a load of time adjusting the files. This indicates they might not know what they're doing....you shouldn't have to pay for their lack of competence by the hour!</p>

<p>We've just <a href="http://docs.aker.me/v1.0/docs/how-to-make-your-kit">created a resource page</a> for making AKER kits (our other project) which you can use to find someone who can help make the OSBH hives too.</p>

<p>FYI <a class="mention" href="/users/micdasilva">@micdasilva</a> - plywood will last quite a long time, and you don't have to treat it with chemicals. You can use linseed oil or non-toxic paints. </p>

              <p>Yeah, it is not cheap to mill the hive with cnc and the wood typically will not last long outdoors. Except if you charge it with chemicals and the pay an extra for it (in cash and environmental sustainability).I am in Portugal trying to get a hive made with CORK (sustainable, durable, resistant to the outdoors and beautiful looking) for less than 300$. Not easy but I am hoping to get there buying and producing local.In any case this will hardly compete with traditional beekeeping.Hoping to share the results soon...</p>

              <p>Danibo,</p>

<p>Our shop in the US you could make one for about $300 if you are not a member.  Pricing is $55 for ply, 2 hours on CNC @ $90 p/h and $45 for the setup of the CNC file.  If you are a member, we charge $149 per month to use the shop and you can bring or buy your material.</p>

<p>$1800 seems shameful for someone to charge to make these for you unless they are making out exotic wood and coating with the tears of puppies.  =)</p>
