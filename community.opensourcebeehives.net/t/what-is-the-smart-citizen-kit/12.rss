The [Smart Citizen Kit][1] is an open source wifi-enabled sensor board that can transmit data to the Smart Citizen online platform. Together, [Fablab Barcelona][2] and [Open Tech Forever][3] are developing a customised sensor layer to make the Smart Citizen appropriate for monitoring beehive conditions.

Please post any questions or comments below.

            <p>I've tried to use the SCK but it is a hot mess.  The user forums over there are plagued with people having every kind of issue imaginable: board component failures, firmware bugs, interface bugs, connectivity problems, etc...etc...etc...  Is the SCK really ready for deployment in another project at this point?  Could the multitude of SCK issues hold this project back significantly?  Is this something that potential backers/collaborators should be made aware of?</p>

<p>edited to add that I assume the SCK will be fully up and running at some point, but right now its causing headaches even for people who are pretty comfortable working with programmable electronics.  Can't imagine how frustrating it could be for people who are more interested in beekeeping than board troubleshooting.  Just something to keep in mind when discussing sensors, electronics and such.</p>

            <p>Where can I find more information? Stay up to date etc. <br>None of these parties mention anything about this on their own website? </p>

<p>Update: I now understand it's part of the crowdfunded project: <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/open-source-beehives" rel="nofollow">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/open-source-beehives</a>But still there's very little information available. </p>

            <p>Is there any discussion of using a bluetooth module?  They're significantly lower powered and would be a great alternative to wifi for battery-powered projects.</p>
