        <p>Hi All,<br>I'd like to offer fabrication services for those around the Minneapolis &amp; St. Paul, Minnesota, area. I've just joined the site but have been following it for a few months. I've been interested in beekeeping for several years but haven't been able to get a spot in the highly desirable University of Minnesota extension program for beekeeping. There are just a few classes and they sell out very quickly and we are required to take a course to get a beekeeping permit in the city.</p>

<p>I have a start-up business making wood products using digital fabrication and traditional woodworking methods and am designing for the 4'x8' CNC router and 24"x36" 90W CO2 laser I use. I'd like to be part of the product and be a resource for people who need fabrication services. Finegrain Studios only uses FSC and reclaimed wood as well as timber from my family farm. Finishes are either certified non-toxic commercial products with a preference toward natural oils or my homemade mineral oil and beeswax wood finish...made with the help of Minnesota bees!</p>

<p>Please PM me for more information. My website hasn't yet launched but will in the next month.<br>Andy Fahl<br>Owner, Chief Elf<br>Finegrain Studios, Ltd.<br>finegrainstudios.com</p>

        <p>Hi Andy - very cool to hear. I'm also in Minneapolis. Just finishing up a class with the Beez Kneez located in Minneapolis. The class spans a summer and is entirely experiential. Absolutely stellar experience. I'm working with a few other folks to host a small apiary on a nearby farm.</p>

<p>We aren't going to do an OS Beehive because we'd like to Langstroth's rather than Warre or Top Bars (simply because that's what we've learned on, I haven't talked to anyone else doing the latter ones in MN, and I want to get the honey production of the Langstroth). But I've been following OS Beehives with interest and even did an interview with Tristan for my podcast: <a href="http://okcast.org/2014/09/episode-18-citizen-science-and-open-source-beehives-with-tristan-copley-smith/" rel="nofollow">http://okcast.org/2014/09/episode-18-citizen-science-and-open-source-beehives-with-tristan-copley-smith/</a></p>

<p>Was considering joining the Hack Factory (in my neighborhood) to do a OS Beehive Warre just to see how it works, but not sure I'd buy bees to put it in. Definitely would join to build the sensor - I'd like to put one in a hive next year if possible.</p>

<p>Would love to chat with you more.</p>

<p>Alex</p>

        <p>Alex,Happy to hear from you! I knew there had to be other Minnesotans here. We're still a big agriculture state and our little friends are important to us! I understand what you're saying about Langstroth hives. They are the standard design for where we live and for most of the US. I have looked at the commercial suppliers and it's hard to compete with the prices they offer for Langstroth components but I think there could be an opportunity with the right materials and scale. I live in Minneapolis and would be happy to meet up with you for a chat.Andy</p>

I've just joined the site but have been following it for a few months. I've been interested in beekeeping for several years but haven't been able to get a spot in the highly desirable University of Minnesota extension program for beekeeping. There are just a few classes and they sell out very quickly and we are required to take a course to get a beekeeping permit in the city.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have a start-up business making wood products using digital fabrication and traditional woodworking methods and am designing for the 4'x8' CNC router and 24\"x36\" 90W CO2 laser I use. I'd like to be part of the product and be a resource for people who need fabrication services. Finegrain Studios only uses FSC and reclaimed wood as well as timber from my family farm. Finishes are either certified non-toxic commercial products with a preference toward natural oils or my homemade mineral oil and beeswax wood finish...made with the help of Minnesota bees!<\/p>\n\n<p>Please PM me for more information. My website hasn't yet launched but will in the next month.<br>Andy Fahl<br>Owner, Chief Elf<br>Finegrain Studios, Ltd.<br>finegrainstudios.com<\/p>","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2015-08-06T20:16:56.109-04:00","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"avg_time":16,"incoming_link_count":3,"reads":4,"score":16.6,"yours":false,"topic_slug":"fabrication-services-in-minnesota-usa","topic_id":267,"display_username":"Andy Fahl","primary_group_name":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null},{"id":3,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null},{"id":4,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null},{"id":5,"count":0,"hidden":true,"can_act":null},{"id":6,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null},{"id":7,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null},{"id":8,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":157,"hidden":false,"hidden_reason_id":null,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false},{"id":916,"name":"Alex","username":"alexanderjfink","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/community.opensourcebeehives.net/alexanderjfink/{size}/251.png","uploaded_avatar_id":251,"created_at":"2015-09-05T15:51:09.447-04:00","cooked":"<p>Hi Andy - very cool to hear.

I have looked at the commercial suppliers and it's hard to compete with the prices they offer for Langstroth components but I think there could be an opportunity with the right materials and scale.
