        <p>Hi All,<br>I'd like to offer fabrication services for those around the Minneapolis &amp; St. Paul, Minnesota, area. I've just joined the site but have been following it for a few months. I've been interested in beekeeping for several years but haven't been able to get a spot in the highly desirable University of Minnesota extension program for beekeeping. There are just a few classes and they sell out very quickly and we are required to take a course to get a beekeeping permit in the city.</p>

<p>I have a start-up business making wood products using digital fabrication and traditional woodworking methods and am designing for the 4'x8' CNC router and 24"x36" 90W CO2 laser I use. I'd like to be part of the product and be a resource for people who need fabrication services. Finegrain Studios only uses FSC and reclaimed wood as well as timber from my family farm. Finishes are either certified non-toxic commercial products with a preference toward natural oils or my homemade mineral oil and beeswax wood finish...made with the help of Minnesota bees!</p>

<p>Please PM me for more information. My website hasn't yet launched but will in the next month.<br>Andy Fahl<br>Owner, Chief Elf<br>Finegrain Studios, Ltd.<br>finegrainstudios.com</p>

        <p>Hi Andy - very cool to hear. I'm also in Minneapolis. Just finishing up a class with the Beez Kneez located in Minneapolis. The class spans a summer and is entirely experiential. Absolutely stellar experience. I'm working with a few other folks to host a small apiary on a nearby farm.</p>

<p>We aren't going to do an OS Beehive because we'd like to Langstroth's rather than Warre or Top Bars (simply because that's what we've learned on, I haven't talked to anyone else doing the latter ones in MN, and I want to get the honey production of the Langstroth). But I've been following OS Beehives with interest and even did an interview with Tristan for my podcast: <a href="http://okcast.org/2014/09/episode-18-citizen-science-and-open-source-beehives-with-tristan-copley-smith/" rel="nofollow">http://okcast.org/2014/09/episode-18-citizen-science-and-open-source-beehives-with-tristan-copley-smith/</a></p>

<p>Was considering joining the Hack Factory (in my neighborhood) to do a OS Beehive Warre just to see how it works, but not sure I'd buy bees to put it in. Definitely would join to build the sensor - I'd like to put one in a hive next year if possible.</p>

<p>Would love to chat with you more.</p>

<p>Alex</p>

        <p>Alex,Happy to hear from you! I knew there had to be other Minnesotans here. We're still a big agriculture state and our little friends are important to us! I understand what you're saying about Langstroth hives. They are the standard design for where we live and for most of the US. I have looked at the commercial suppliers and it's hard to compete with the prices they offer for Langstroth components but I think there could be an opportunity with the right materials and scale. I live in Minneapolis and would be happy to meet up with you for a chat.Andy</p>

I'd like to be part of the product and be a resource for people who need fabrication services. Finegrain Studios only uses FSC and reclaimed wood as well as timber from my family farm. Finishes are either certified non-toxic commercial products with a preference toward natural oils or my homemade mineral oil and beeswax wood finish...made with the help of Minnesota bees!<\/p>\n\n<p>Please PM me for more information.

I'm also in Minneapolis. Just finishing up a class with the Beez Kneez located in Minneapolis. The class spans a summer and is entirely experiential. Absolutely stellar experience. I'm working with a few other folks to host a small apiary on a nearby farm.<\/p>\n\n<p>We aren't going to do an OS Beehive because we'd like to Langstroth's rather than Warre or Top Bars (simply because that's what we've learned on, I haven't talked to anyone else doing the latter ones in MN, and I want to get the honey production of the Langstroth). But I've been following OS Beehives with interest and even did an interview with Tristan for my podcast: <a href=\"http://okcast.org/2014/09/episode-18-citizen-science-and-open-source-beehives-with-tristan-copley-smith/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://okcast.org/2014/09/episode-18-citizen-science-and-open-source-beehives-with-tristan-copley-smith/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Was considering joining the Hack Factory (in my neighborhood) to do a OS Beehive Warre just to see how it works, but not sure I'd buy bees to put it in.

They are the standard design for where we live and for most of the US. I have looked at the commercial suppliers and it's hard to compete with the prices they offer for Langstroth components but I think there could be an opportunity with the right materials and scale.
