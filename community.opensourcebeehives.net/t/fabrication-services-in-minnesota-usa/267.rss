    <title>Fabrication services in Minnesota, USA</title>
    <link>http://community.opensourcebeehives.net/t/fabrication-services-in-minnesota-usa/267</link>
    <description>Hi All,
I&#39;d like to offer fabrication services for those around the Minneapolis &amp; St. Paul, Minnesota, area. I&#39;ve just joined the site but have been following it for a few months. I&#39;ve been interested in beekeeping for several years but haven&#39;t been able to get a spot in the highly desirable University of Minnesota extension program for beekeeping. There are just a few classes and they sell out very quickly and we are required to take a course to get a beekeeping permit in the city.

I have a start-up business making wood products using digital fabrication and traditional woodworking methods and am designing for the 4&#39;x8&#39; CNC router and 24&quot;x36&quot; 90W CO2 laser I use. I&#39;d like to be part of the product and be a resource for people who need fabrication services. Finegrain Studios only uses FSC and reclaimed wood as well as timber from my family farm. Finishes are either certified non-toxic commercial products with a preference toward natural oils or my homemade mineral oil and beeswax wood finish...made with the help of Minnesota bees!

Please PM me for more information. My website hasn&#39;t yet launched but will in the next month.

              <p>Alex,Happy to hear from you! I knew there had to be other Minnesotans here. We're still a big agriculture state and our little friends are important to us! I understand what you're saying about Langstroth hives. They are the standard design for where we live and for most of the US. I have looked at the commercial suppliers and it's hard to compete with the prices they offer for Langstroth components but I think there could be an opportunity with the right materials and scale. I live in Minneapolis and would be happy to meet up with you for a chat.Andy</p>

              <p>Hi Andy - very cool to hear. I'm also in Minneapolis. Just finishing up a class with the Beez Kneez located in Minneapolis. The class spans a summer and is entirely experiential. Absolutely stellar experience. I'm working with a few other folks to host a small apiary on a nearby farm.</p>

<p>We aren't going to do an OS Beehive because we'd like to Langstroth's rather than Warre or Top Bars (simply because that's what we've learned on, I haven't talked to anyone else doing the latter ones in MN, and I want to get the honey production of the Langstroth). But I've been following OS Beehives with interest and even did an interview with Tristan for my podcast: <a href="http://okcast.org/2014/09/episode-18-citizen-science-and-open-source-beehives-with-tristan-copley-smith/" rel="nofollow">http://okcast.org/2014/09/episode-18-citizen-science-and-open-source-beehives-with-tristan-copley-smith/</a></p>

<p>Was considering joining the Hack Factory (in my neighborhood) to do a OS Beehive Warre just to see how it works, but not sure I'd buy bees to put it in. Definitely would join to build the sensor - I'd like to put one in a hive next year if possible.</p>

<p>Would love to chat with you more.</p>

<p>Alex</p>
