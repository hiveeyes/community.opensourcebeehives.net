      <p>Zup! My name is Tom van de Beek and I'm the founder of The Tipping Point Foundation, based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. One of our projects is called I Love Beeing, a fast growing movement of young people committed to saving the bees. We organize awareness campaigns, but we're also bringing urban beekeeping to the next level by having high standards as far as natural beekeeping goes. In practice this means we try to take care of our bees the best we can, without taking away their honey and without using anything chemical in or around the hive. Also, read <a href="http://holland-herald.com/2013/07/for-the-buzzzzz/" rel="nofollow">this article</a>. I'm pretty excited to see how the combination of high tech and old school beekeeping could potentially save the bees, and therefore ourselves.</p>

      <p>Hi - My name is Mark Milotay, and I have been beekeeping for 3+ years. I have a mixture of top bar and Langstroth hives in my beeyard (I am foundationless in the Langstroths). I am planning to introduce a variation on Phil Chandler's Pagoda hive design. If it my modified model works, I will move the rest of my hives to it. </p>

<p>I am located in Victoria, BC, so I have the benefit of a mild climate, although moisture is one of the big issues we have to contend with in our hives here.</p>

      <p>Hello World!</p>

<p>I'm Ken from Minnesota, USA and while I work with lasers in manufacturing in my day job, I've been keeping bees for 4-5 years and for the past two years, I have been working on building datalogging capabilities into my own bee hives!</p>

<p>Last spring, I installed a digital scale and some temperature probes on one of my bee hives, but I was relying on a wireless connection to collect the data without a reliable hardware backup and after about a week of data, the connection would drop out and I would lose data.  My young children prevent quick prototyping, so I've been working on a second version for spring 2014.</p>

<p>I backed the Apitronics Kickstarter ( <a href="http://apitronics.com/" rel="nofollow">http://apitronics.com/</a> )and Louis will be building me a more robust data transmission system and handling a lot of the programming that I don't have time to reliably reproduce.</p>

<p>At the same time, I've moved from my original attempt to repurpose postal scales to designing a dedicated unit around a single load cell.  I've been documenting some of my work at <a href="http://hackerbee.com" rel="nofollow">http://hackerbee.com</a> although it's hard to really write a useful guide before I'm finished making mistakes!</p>

<p>Immediately, I could use help writing firmware for a PIC microcontroller -- I've just ordered a first prototype hive scale control board that will allow hands-on programming and debugging.  I'll be able to slog through the programming myself, it'll just take a couple months to finish.  I'd be quite willing to redesign around an Atmel microprocessor if I can hand off programming to someone much more skilled than I.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's me -- I'll direct some other collaborators who are tinkering with other bee hive sensors here and we'll see where we end up!</p>

<p>I'm really enthusiastic about this project, this is definitely what I need to grow into apiculture (5 hives until now). I used to work on open-source greenhouse problematics (automatisation, domotics, captors etc) and I publish some experiments on a blog : mgandecki.bdspartan.com/blog<br>++</p>

<p>I've been keeping bees for over 10 years.  I came across beekeeping in a book when I was about 15.  I read everything I could get my hands on and convinced my parents to let me keep 2 hives on our hobby farm.</p>

<p>This last year I worked as summer help at the Univ. of Minnesota Bee Lab.  I'll be starting a small bee breeding operation in the spring of 2014 with friend of mine producing queen bees and nucleus colonies that are adapted to our northern climate.</p>

<p>I have a B.S. degree in electrical engineering which is starting to collect dust.  I currently work in sterilization at 3M working with spores and various methods of killing them.  My current winter projects include, a 3ft x 3ft cnc router, android app for managing hive evaluations and queen rearing records, and assembly of equipment for the season ahead.</p>

      <p>Jim Race here, from the Sierra Foothills in California. We are n00bs to beekeeping, but we have one Kenyan Top Bar hive going strong, even through the recent cold snap which saw temperatures near zero F. The weather however, has warmed up and they're literally digging through the snow to find pollen. Good stuff!</p>
