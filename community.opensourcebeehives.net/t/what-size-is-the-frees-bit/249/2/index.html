        <p>Trying to get a CTB 6.1 cut here in the Netherlands. The company I am trying to use says that he can only use an 8mm bit and that there are several cuts that seemingly require a 4mm bit. He says that he can only use an 8mm bit.</p>

<p>Has anyone else experienced this?  What size bit is expected to be used?</p>

        <p>He is most likely trying to remove the material in a single pass.. He is correct that doing it that way requires a bit larger than 4mm due to the thickness as a 4mm bit would most likely deflect too much and snap. </p>

<p>However i regularly use 1/4" bits on ply with no problem what so ever so a little extreme to say he needs to use an 8mm.</p>

<p>Once the 8mm or 1/4inch bit has contoured the part, as long as the tabs/tags or vacuum bed/double-sided tape are good enough to hold the part in place a 4mm bit could be used in a second operation called rest machining to remove the fillets left behind by the larger bits.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.  </p>

        <p>hi,<br>I had three hives produced in Bemmel in the Netherlands, they used a 6mm bit. at feijenSP, for 160 Euro. they know the drill, it would be a good idea to go there.</p>
