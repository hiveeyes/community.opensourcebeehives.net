    <description>Hi, im new here, But love the effort thats been put into the beehive designs in true opensource style, and growing the bee keeper community, So i thought i would join the effort. 

Because i router all parts from 3d when there are 3d strategies involved. I have layed all the parts from the 3d Barcelona_Warre_Hive into a parasolid x_t Nested into an 8x4 sheet in the same layout as the original, If of use to anyone, (parasolid text file is version 27, if anyone requires an earlier version or different 3d format please contact me and i will be happy to re format) 

View and Download file here: https://grabcad.com/library/barcelona_warre_hive-8x4-layout-1

If anyone here is looking for cnc flat packs of these in the uk.. I can cut these for £100. Please enquire via my website: www.southwestcnc.co.uk

Cheers.
