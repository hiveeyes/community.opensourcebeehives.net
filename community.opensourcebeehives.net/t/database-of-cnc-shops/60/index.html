        <p>Hello,</p>

<p>   We've had four hives already cut, two of each design. It was hard to locate a place here willing to do it but we found a place in Pompano Beach, FL. Here is their information.</p>

<p><strong>Mirart Inc.</strong><br>2707 Gateway Drive • Pompano Beach, FL. 33069-4323<br>PHONE: (954) 974-5230 • PHONE: (800) 327-8944<br>FAX: (800) 647-2780 • FAX: (954) 974-8442<br>E-mail us: webinfo@mirart.com<br><a href="http://www.mirart.com" rel="nofollow">www.mirart.com</a></p>

<p>We found them by accident when we were watching an episode of Fish Tank Kings.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing <a class="mention" href="/users/jess">@Jess</a>! I'd love to know how much your guy charged for the service, since theres been a lot of fluctuation between different shops - if you wouldn't mind?</p>

        <p>Sure,</p>

<p> There was a $250 one time set-up charge tied in but to have all four hives cut it was about $1250 USD. I did a 50% deposit for them to get started, I think it took them like 4hrs per design to cut them. I live in driving distance so I avoided any freight charges but they offer freight and packaging solutions as well. Since I'm trying to keep costs down and wish to sell some hives online and at local flea markets via our business we've been looking at ways to produce them more cost effective. </p>

<p>If we reordered them they gave us some new figures which is now like :</p>

<p><strong>BCN</strong></p>

<p>$295             for labor</p>

<p>$7.50           acrylic windows (3 x $2.50 each) - (part of the Open Source design)</p>

<p>$75               plywood (one sheet)</p>

<p><strong>$377.50       Total + tax</strong></p>

<p><strong>CTB</strong></p>

<p>$232             for labor</p>

<p>$ 75              plywood (one sheet)</p>

<p><strong>$307.00       Total + tax</strong></p>

<p>That is the prices they've quoted me per hive. We've discussed using acrylic or a acrylic/wood combo which sounds exciting and something we plan to offer. They were a little unfamilar with the concept of open source tech and were a little confused about what it meant but after I explained and told them that I would need to share improvements or any changes made to the design in order to share with the public so others can make them they said they were open to it. Hope this helps!</p>
