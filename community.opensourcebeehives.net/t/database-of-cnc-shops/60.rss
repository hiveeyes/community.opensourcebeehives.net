    <title>Database of CNC Shops</title>
    <link>http://community.opensourcebeehives.net/t/database-of-cnc-shops/60</link>
    <description>Why not create a database of all known shops that can create these designs in house?
Things to possibly list;

 1. Name of shop
 2. General/Specific region, address
 3. Contact Name
 4. Cost for service(setup fee, material fees, other fees)

The idea here is to manufacture close to home as to keep costs down, as well as environmental impact.
Any suggestions welcome.</description>

              <p>Sure,</p>

<p> There was a $250 one time set-up charge tied in but to have all four hives cut it was about $1250 USD. I did a 50% deposit for them to get started, I think it took them like 4hrs per design to cut them. I live in driving distance so I avoided any freight charges but they offer freight and packaging solutions as well. Since I'm trying to keep costs down and wish to sell some hives online and at local flea markets via our business we've been looking at ways to produce them more cost effective. </p>

<p>If we reordered them they gave us some new figures which is now like :</p>

<p><strong>BCN</strong></p>

<p>$295             for labor</p>

<p>$7.50           acrylic windows (3 x $2.50 each) - (part of the Open Source design)</p>

<p>$75               plywood (one sheet)</p>

<p><strong>$377.50       Total + tax</strong></p>

<p><strong>CTB</strong></p>

<p>$232             for labor</p>

<p>$ 75              plywood (one sheet)</p>

<p><strong>$307.00       Total + tax</strong></p>

<p>That is the prices they've quoted me per hive. We've discussed using acrylic or a acrylic/wood combo which sounds exciting and something we plan to offer. They were a little unfamilar with the concept of open source tech and were a little confused about what it meant but after I explained and told them that I would need to share improvements or any changes made to the design in order to share with the public so others can make them they said they were open to it. Hope this helps!</p>
