      <p>Hello Everybody !</p>

<p>I'm just doing a quick report here.<br>On saturday and sunday, 18th and 19th of january we gathered at a friend's garage in Strasbourg to make Waré beehives.<br>The wood was "Mélèze", because it resists rot, the inside of the hives were waxed (to allow the condensing water to flow out) and each part has an opening to put in a window.<br>In two days, we produced 78 beehives, each comprising a bottom, a top and 4 elements. Each participant could return with a few beehives. I personnaly made 10 for myself.</p>

<p>The design of these Warré hive are Sturdy, Simple and effective. We could somehow mass-product them on a small scale.</p>

<p>Here is the link to the pictures:<br><a href="http://bdpalsace.dyndns.org/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=8" class="onebox" rel="nofollow">http://bdpalsace.dyndns.org/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=8</a></p>

<p>For fellow french speakers, more informations are available on the website.</p>

      <p>There will be another workshop next winter. People usually have to subscribe and pay for the wood 6 month in advance. The language of the workshop is of course french ! I will keep this community informed of the next workshop.</p>

<p>We buy the wood in bulk, pre-cup and pre-dryed from a woodmill.<br>Our bee-hives are practical and functionnal but very rough.</p>

<p>There is only screwing, nailling and waxing involved in the workshop.<br>People still have to set up the windows, the shutter and the combs start by themselves.</p>
