        <p>I'll post two plywoods that are most commonly used in boat building and exhibit some of the criteria listed.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>Lightweight<br>CNC Routable (very flat, consistent thickness)<br>Non-toxic</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p>Expensive<br>Not rot or insect resistant</p>

<p><strong>Meranti (aka Lauan)</strong><br><a href="http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/hardwoods/dark-red-meranti/" title="Wood Database Entry">Wood Database Entry</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorea">Wikipedia</a><br><a href="http://www.edensaw.com/mainsite/store1/StoreProducts/ProductList/411">Example Pricing</a></p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>Strong<br>Moderately rot-resistant<br>CNC Routable (very flat, consistent thickness)</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p>Phenolic glue wears CNC bits faster<br>I'm not certain about toxicity<br>Expensive</p>

<p>Both materials will need to be sealed in order to be durable in an outdoor environment.</p>

<p>Once this list of potential materials grows maybe we could set up a wiki/other database to track usage, sources, and criteria.</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>   The CNC shop near me works with a lot of acrylic and brought up the possibility of making the existing designs in acrylic or wood/acrylic combo instead of the CARB 2 plywood. What are your thoughts? </p>

<p>From what I've read acrylic is non-toxic, and weatherproof. It has a tendency to soften in high temperatures though but it doesn't melt unless exposed to very high temps. If it's safe for bees it might be a great idea and requires no painting making it easier for more people to use and set up and clean. Not to mention it would probably look awesome.</p>

<p>Material: Acrylic Glass</p>

        <p>Outside of using thin (0.80 inches thick ) plexi glass to repair a broken window in my garage that's about it. </p>

<p>Acrylic glass comes in different brands and forms. Price and other features depends on the type your purchase. Doing a google search I found some acrylic sheet companies. I guess it all comes down to what type to get. You would need the same size and thickness as the plywood sheets would be.</p>

<p> I'm still looking to find prices for a 4ft x 8ft x 3/4 inches thick acrylic sheets online. Haven't found it yet but I'll keep looking around.</p>

        <p>Wikihouse 4.0 at the Building Center in London uses <a href="http://www.smartply.com/">SmartPly</a>.</p>

<p>We should investigate this for pros and cons and local availability. I just came across it so I haven't done research yet. Will update post this weekend.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/ch10/final/c10s05.pdf"><strong>Plywood Manufacturing - Environmental Protection Agency</strong></a></p>

<p>Plywood is a building material consisting of veneers (thin wood layers or plies) bonded with an<br>adhesive. There are two types of plywood: softwood plywood and hardwood plywood. Softwoods<br>generally correspond to coniferous species. The most commonly used softwoods for manufacturing plywood are firs and pines. </p>

<p>Hardwoods generally correspond to deciduous species. For hardwood plywood, commonly used wood species include oak, poplar, maple, cherry, and larch. </p>

<p>Softwood plywood is manufactured by gluing several layers of dry softwood veneers together<br>with an adhesive. Softwood plywood is used for wall siding, sheathing, roof decking, concrete<br>formboards, floors, and containers. Softwood plywood is classified under Standard Industrial<br>Classification (SIC) code 2436, and North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code    321212 for “Softwood Plywood and Veneer”.</p>

<p>Hardwood plywood is made of hardwood veneers bonded with an adhesive. The outer layers<br>(face and back) surround a core which is usually lumber, veneer, particleboard, or medium density fiberboard. Hardwood plywood may be pressed into panels or plywood components (e.g., curved hardwood plywood, seat backs, chair arms, etc.). <strong>Hardwood plywood is used for interior applications</strong> such as furniture, cabinets, architectural millwork, paneling, flooring, store fixtures, and doors. Hardwood plywood is classified under SIC code 2435 and NAICS code 321211, for “Hardwood Plywood and Veneer”.</p>

<p>Softwood plywood plants typically produce softwood veneers and softwood plywood on the same<br>plant site. However, most hardwood plywood and veneer plants either produce hardwood plywood or  hardwood veneer. Hardwood veneer plants cut and dry hardwood veneers. Hardwood plywood plants typically purchase hardwood veneers and press the veneers onto a purchased core material.</p>

        <p>Hi<br>I believe the best material (in combination or not with wood) could be cork.<br>It is one of the first natural choices of bees, when choosing their nest.<br>It is 100% sustainable and no trees are cut down to bring us the material. It totally addresses the criteria and it is beautiful. The only issue I see now is the cost. As I am in Portugal (worldwide home town of cork related products), I will be investigating, talking with the industry leaders and doing some tests myself to find the best solution from agglomerated cork (technically and economically). <br>I will get back.</p>

        <p>Hi Micdasilva</p>

<p>Thanks for the input on this. I'm working in the Green Fab Lab in Barcelona, would love to mill some Portuguese cork if we can get hold of enough.  Also maybe syncing with the Fab Labs down there to get something working. What do you think?</p>

        <p>Hi Jonathan,<br>What do you mean mill some cork? You mean getting the raw material out of the tree to work on? Maybe I can assist you or direct you to the best source.<br>In the next few days I will have the hands on some agglomerate to test. Txt for the tip on fab lab Lisbon, I will get in touch with them and ask them a hand. <br>I am also thinking on recycled cork, from wine caps. That would be something nice as well. To mill for instance <img src="/plugins/emoji/images/wink.png" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="64" height="64"></p>

        <p>Cork can be a fantastic materia for CNC milling. It is soft and malleable enough to be cut into wonderful curvatures.  Think a beehive in waveform.  With access to this material + fab Lab lisbon + some grasshopper plugins for Rhino then we have whole new hive style to play with.  If you grab enough we can make a cork hive for sure. <img src="/plugins/emoji/images/wink.png" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>

        <p>hi!</p>

<p>I recently came across a new material called Valchromat . We are making some tests with it and so far it's been good. It's coloured, moisture resistant and easy to machine. </p>

<p>Also the company that makes it claims i'ts non-toxic "Formaldehyde emissions are within limits set by European standards for wood-based materials."</p>

<p>Here's a link<br><a href="http://www.valchromat.pt/vantagens.aspx?menuid=263" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.valchromat.pt/vantagens.aspx?menuid=263</a></p>

<p>The only problem might bee (you see i wrote it wrong on purpose) the price and availability . Perhaps in the future we can see the pricelist coming down.</p>

There are two types of plywood: softwood plywood and hardwood plywood. Softwoods<br>generally correspond to coniferous species. The most commonly used softwoods for manufacturing plywood are firs and pines. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hardwoods generally correspond to deciduous species. For hardwood plywood, commonly used wood species include oak, poplar, maple, cherry, and larch. <\/p>\n\n<p>Softwood plywood is manufactured by gluing several layers of dry softwood veneers together<br>with an adhesive. Softwood plywood is used for wall siding, sheathing, roof decking, concrete<br>formboards, floors, and containers. Softwood plywood is classified under Standard Industrial<br>Classification (SIC) code 2436, and North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code    321212 for “Softwood Plywood and Veneer”.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hardwood plywood is made of hardwood veneers bonded with an adhesive. The outer layers<br>(face and back) surround a core which is usually lumber, veneer, particleboard, or medium density fiberboard. Hardwood plywood may be pressed into panels or plywood components (e.g., curved hardwood plywood, seat backs, chair arms, etc.). <strong>Hardwood plywood is used for interior applications<\/strong> such as furniture, cabinets, architectural millwork, paneling, flooring, store fixtures, and doors. Hardwood plywood is classified under SIC code 2435 and NAICS code 321211, for “Hardwood Plywood and Veneer”.<\/p>\n\n<p>Softwood plywood plants typically produce softwood veneers and softwood plywood on the same<br>plant site. However, most hardwood plywood and veneer plants either produce hardwood plywood or  hardwood veneer. Hardwood veneer plants cut and dry hardwood veneers. Hardwood plywood plants typically purchase hardwood veneers and press the veneers onto a purchased core material.<\/p>","post_number":8,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2014-10-01T04:59:42.410-04:00","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":7,"quote_count":0,"avg_time":29,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":17,"score":4.85,"yours":false,"topic_slug":"beehive-materials-research","topic_id":34,"display_username":"Aaron Makaruk","primary_group_name":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/ch10/final/c10s05.pdf","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":"Project Co-Founder","reply_to_user":{"username":"pbeseda","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/community.opensourcebeehives.net/pbeseda/{size}/44.png","uploaded_avatar_id":44},"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null},{"id":3,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null},{"id":4,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null},{"id":5,"count":0,"hidden":true,"can_act":null},{"id":6,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null},{"id":7,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null},{"id":8,"count":0,"hidden":false,"can_act":null}],"moderator":true,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":1,"hidden":false,"hidden_reason_id":null,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false},{"id":513,"name":"mario silva","username":"micdasilva","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/community.opensourcebeehives.net/micdasilva/{size}/203.png","uploaded_avatar_id":203,"created_at":"2015-01-19T12:15:04.241-05:00","cooked":"<p>Hi<br>I believe the best material (in combination or not with wood) could be cork.<br>It is one of the first natural choices of bees, when choosing their nest.<br>It is 100% sustainable and no trees are cut down to bring us the material.
