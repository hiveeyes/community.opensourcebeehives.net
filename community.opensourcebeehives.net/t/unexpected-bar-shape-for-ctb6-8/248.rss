    <title>Unexpected Bar Shape for CTB6.8</title>
    <link>http://community.opensourcebeehives.net/t/unexpected-bar-shape-for-ctb6-8/248</link>
    <description>I just cut my first CTB 6.X and everything ran pretty well!
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/280/deb575045de7c2e1.JPG&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;&gt; 

However, the top bars don&#39;t seem to rest as easily on the hive as they did in the older designs and the shape of the bars seems to be inverted from earlier designs. Here&#39;s what they look like:
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/281/06447b0d470887e5.JPG&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt; 

Did I do something wrong? Did I misread the 5mm pocket layer or is this correct?

Thanks!
