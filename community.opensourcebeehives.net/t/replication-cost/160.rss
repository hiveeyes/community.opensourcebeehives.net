    <description>I am interested in replicating the TopBar design. But I&#x27;m a total noob at applying myself to fabrication. 

Here in Seattle there is a [maker space business][1] that charges $3/min for laser cutting. Is using a laser cutter rather than cnc router appropriate? Does anyone have an estimate of how much time it would take to cut the pieces?

From a different route, if I was to get a [ShapeOko][2] cnc router could the beehive be cut with it, or is the ShapeOko cutting space too small?

Thanks!
