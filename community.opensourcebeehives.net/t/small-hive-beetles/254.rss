    <title>Small hive beetles</title>
    <link>http://community.opensourcebeehives.net/t/small-hive-beetles/254</link>
    <description>How are people dealing with small hive beetles on the CTB? I just installed bees a couple weeks ago and am already seeing a bunch of them. Anyone developing a design for modification of the bottom board to allow for a mineral oil trap?? Anyone want to collaborate with me on this?</description>

              <p>We lost our CTB to beetles, the 4 Warre hives at the same location are fine.  I suspect the vent holes on the gable ends is how they got in.  We plan on covering them with screen in the future.</p>
