    <description>Hi there!!
I am Kostas Panayiotakis and i am the inventor of Automatic Honey Extraction Comb. Furthermore I am already working to a new type of beehive that could be used from amateurs and professional beekeepers as well with which honey can be extracted automaticaly from the beehive without distarbing the bees !! I am looking for investors or donations. Any comment will always be welcome.

              <p>Hallo geo3geo. <br>Thank you for your interesting.<br>Recent beekeeping has few main disadvantages. You will see them if you watch this ppt file (copy paste to your browser): <br><a href="http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/kostasbsdoa-2314798-bsdoa-needs-help/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/kostasbsdoa-2314798-bsdoa-needs-help/</a></p>

<p>But particularly the described automatic beehive differs to: <br>1) Automatic Honey extraction-honey is extracting automaticaly without open the beehive without ennoy the bees.<br>2) This beehive is preventing the natural swarming.<br>So you ask how it work? Ok,.. which one of these basic features you mean?</p>

<p>It is little complicated to explain you in two sentences as you ask. About how honey is extracting automaticaly from the hive please follow this link. There are also figures at that note that will help you to understand the way it works.<br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/bsdoa-beekeeping-green-beekeeping/plastic-honeycomb-for-automatic-honey-extraction/797288566998023" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/notes/bsdoa-beekeeping-green-beekeeping/plastic-honeycomb-for-automatic-honey-extraction/797288566998023</a></p>

<p>I am looking for partners and investors who will join me to the cause of creating a factory that will produse massively our beehive and sell to the beekeepers. If you are interesting to join please let me know. Thanks</p>

              <p>Thank you trizcs.<br>Members of the OSBH can help me with anyway they can.. Even by donating me 5 euros through their Paypal account through my email bsdoainvention@yahoo.com. But that is the less they can do to help me. I am looking for some team that I could coloborate together and not only build the first ever built Automatic Honey Extraction Beehive... It has almost done, you see at the pictures !! Surely many other models will appear more functionable and more practical and usable from amateurs and proffessional beekeepers as well... But the big challenge is to build the first BSDOA system ever built !!! That needs the collaboration of many factors, technicians designers CNC programmers,.. investors, funds,.. and at least 1-2 year of hard work and tests... This is a challenge I put to all the members of your group,.. The challenge to change beekeeping in the world the challenge to bring the revolution in beekeeping !!!!!! Of course we need to create an international BSDOA beekeeping company and I call all the members of your group to become shareholders and I am willing to give even 80% of the patent rights of the inventions that now exists to all the members of the OBSH who are willing to participate creating the international company. And are willing to suport the project to all the needed steps of development and establishment.<br>Here is ppt file I made few years ago with the help of some friend, I welcome to watch <a href="http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/kostasbsdoa-2314798-bsdoa-needs-help/" rel="nofollow">http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/kostasbsdoa-2314798-bsdoa-needs-help/</a></p>

<p>And at the other hand there is a competition from Rolex Awards, international !!!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rolexawards.com/about/awards" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.rolexawards.com/about/awards</a></p>

<p>Further more,.. Rolex has the kind will to help people and groups who are willing to help the humanity and increase the quality of life in earth, so Rolex has this competition I also let you know about that we could take part of it and win 100.000 Swiss francs !!!! These are the challenges I set to you my friends !!!! But the biggest challenge is to improve the beekeeping system in the world and give to consumers the right to can buy high quality beekeeping products at decreased cost of production. For those who are willing to help pls let as know about !!! And let me know in which way you can help and participate. Preferably I would love if you give me your answers with a recorded video file of you where you will also introduce yourself and tell me your opinion about BSDOA project and how you would like to help. Thanks I wait your response.</p>

<p>Also, I'd be interessted to hear how the device ensures enough honey is left in the hive to allow the bees to live through the Winter?</p>
