    <title>Current Best Version?</title>
    <link>http://community.opensourcebeehives.net/t/current-best-version/239</link>
    <description>I noticed that there are several versions of a V6 design for the Colorado Top Bar (which I will be making). The manual is for the 5.4 version.

At first glance it looks a bit puzzling which version I should be building. Could there be a stickie referencing the latest prefered design files and manual?

Simply put there can be many design iterations and fine tuning before the design is useful and standardised for &quot;production&quot; and it might be useful for casual or first time browsers to have simple links to the current best design, updated manual and example pictures.</description>

              <p>I also would like to know which version would be best for production. More info about the 6.6 can be found in this post (http://community.opensourcebeehives.net/t/design-review-colorado-top-bar-v6-6/225) but I am not sure if that one is ready for milling</p>

              <p>I'd endorse this. I'm also planning to be milling a hive soon, but I have struggled to find my way around the different versions and   the difference with the manual version.</p>
