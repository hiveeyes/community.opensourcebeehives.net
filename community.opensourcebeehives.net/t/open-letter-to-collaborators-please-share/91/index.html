Bees, who pollinate of over 1/3 of the food we consume, are dying off at a terrifying rate. Internationally, we have lost roughly 32% of colonies, and the problem, named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colony Collapse Disorder<\/a>, is continuing to gain momentum. Research indicates a mixture of pesticides, fungicides, mites, genetically modified organics, climate change and bad beekeeping practices are to blame, but significant questions about the causes and their prevention remain.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.opensourcebeehives.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Source Beehives<\/a> project is a partnership between <a href=\"http://www.opentechforever.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Tech Forever<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.fablabbcn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fab Lab Barcelona<\/a>. It is our conviction that we citizens can and must actively help solve this crisis. Legislation, regulation, and official involvement have so far failed to address the problem. We must take matters into our own hands and avert this crisis to sustain our existence.<\/p>\n\n<p>The OSBH project has two elements :<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We have developed two beehive designs that can freely downloaded,<br><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNC_router\" rel=\"nofollow\">'printed'<\/a> from a single wood panel, and assembled without<br>screws or glues. (<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/79178831\" rel=\"nofollow\">See our video<\/a>)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>We are developing a beehive sensor board to monitor conditions<br> relevant to colony health, and share the data online openly via the<br><a href=\"http://www.smartcitizen.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smart Citizen<\/a> platform.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol><p>The aim of the project is to create a citizen-led mesh network of data-generating honey bee colonies for local, national, and international study of the causes and prevention of Colony Collapse Disorder. We hope to awaken a responsible backyard beekeeping &amp; citizen science revolution while improving our understanding of honey bee health in industrialised countries and promoting their recovery. <\/p>\n\n<p>These aims require collaboration between citizens, academic and research institutes, technologists, organisations and designers. We are actively looking for partnerships, and appreciate any help with outreach to relevant groups.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Citizens<\/strong>: Consider <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/diy-backyard-beekeeping-47031701#slide-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">becoming a beekeeper<\/a>. If it is conducive to your lifestyle and you are determined, print or order one of our hives, get yourself a colony, and participate in strengthening the bee population in your area. You can also plant <a href=\"http://www.themelissagarden.com/plants.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">bee forage<\/a> in your garden and wider community.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Academic &amp; Research Institutes<\/strong>: Advise us on the development of our colony sensors and partner with us to study the data generated once the project is implemented. Generate useful insights into the problem of and solution to Colony Collapse Disorder once these elements are in place.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Technologists &amp; Designers<\/strong>: Help us develop hive sensor boards, beehives, and digital infrastructure for sharing and hosting the generated data.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Organisations<\/strong>: Help us with outreach to increase participation in the project and build partnerships.<\/p>\n\n<p>Below are some bite sized ways you can help the project:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Print and test our beehives<\/li>\n<li>Spread the word about the problem of CCD<\/li>\n<li>Help design and test our hive-relevant sensor board<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/diy-backyard-beekeeping-47031701#slide-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Become a backyard beekeeper<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Plant <a href=\"http://www.themelissagarden.com/plants.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">bee forage<\/a> in your community<\/li>\n<li>Contact or recommend academic &amp; research partners on the OSBH project<\/li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://community.opensourcebeehives.net\">Join our community<\/a> and share knowledge in our forum<\/li>\n<li>Review our <a href=\"http://community.opensourcebeehives.net/t/warre-hive-v1-0-review/38?u=trizcs\">Warré<\/a> and <a href=\"http://community.opensourcebeehives.net/t/colorado-top-bar-version-3-0/36?u=trizcs\">Colorado Top Bar<\/a> designs and give feedback<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/79178831\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spread the word about the OSBH project<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Donate to the OSBH project<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Please help spread this open letter by clicking and sharing the link button at the bottom of this post.

<p>The natural systems that feed our planet are under threat. Bees, who pollinate of over 1/3 of the food we consume, are dying off at a terrifying rate. Internationally, we have lost roughly 32% of colonies, and the problem, named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder" rel="nofollow">Colony Collapse Disorder</a>, is continuing to gain momentum. Research indicates a mixture of pesticides, fungicides, mites, genetically modified organics, climate change and bad beekeeping practices are to blame, but significant questions about the causes and their prevention remain.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.opensourcebeehives.net" rel="nofollow">Open Source Beehives</a> project is a partnership between <a href="http://www.opentechforever.com" rel="nofollow">Open Tech Forever</a> and <a href="http://www.fablabbcn.com" rel="nofollow">Fab Lab Barcelona</a>. It is our conviction that we citizens can and must actively help solve this crisis. Legislation, regulation, and official involvement have so far failed to address the problem. We must take matters into our own hands and avert this crisis to sustain our existence.</p>

<p>The OSBH project has two elements :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We have developed two beehive designs that can freely downloaded,<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNC_router" rel="nofollow">'printed'</a> from a single wood panel, and assembled without<br>screws or glues. (<a href="http://vimeo.com/79178831" rel="nofollow">See our video</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>We are developing a beehive sensor board to monitor conditions<br> relevant to colony health, and share the data online openly via the<br><a href="http://www.smartcitizen.me" rel="nofollow">Smart Citizen</a> platform.</p></li>
</ol><p>The aim of the project is to create a citizen-led mesh network of data-generating honey bee colonies for local, national, and international study of the causes and prevention of Colony Collapse Disorder. We hope to awaken a responsible backyard beekeeping &amp; citizen science revolution while improving our understanding of honey bee health in industrialised countries and promoting their recovery. </p>

<p>These aims require collaboration between citizens, academic and research institutes, technologists, organisations and designers. We are actively looking for partnerships, and appreciate any help with outreach to relevant groups.</p>

<p><strong>Citizens</strong>: Consider <a href="http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/diy-backyard-beekeeping-47031701#slide-4" rel="nofollow">becoming a beekeeper</a>. If it is conducive to your lifestyle and you are determined, print or order one of our hives, get yourself a colony, and participate in strengthening the bee population in your area. You can also plant <a href="http://www.themelissagarden.com/plants.html" rel="nofollow">bee forage</a> in your garden and wider community.</p>

<p><strong>Academic &amp; Research Institutes</strong>: Advise us on the development of our colony sensors and partner with us to study the data generated once the project is implemented. Generate useful insights into the problem of and solution to Colony Collapse Disorder once these elements are in place.</p>

<p><strong>Technologists &amp; Designers</strong>: Help us develop hive sensor boards, beehives, and digital infrastructure for sharing and hosting the generated data.</p>

<p><strong>Organisations</strong>: Help us with outreach to increase participation in the project and build partnerships.</p>

<p>Below are some bite sized ways you can help the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Print and test our beehives</li>
<li>Spread the word about the problem of CCD</li>
<li>Help design and test our hive-relevant sensor board</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/diy-backyard-beekeeping-47031701#slide-4" rel="nofollow">Become a backyard beekeeper</a></li>
