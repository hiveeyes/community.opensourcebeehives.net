      <p>Hi all.</p>

<p>I like the designs im seeing on this site.<br>The only thing is they ignore a significant element, which is the frame configuration.<br>to date there are two types 1) top bars 2)Langstroth<br>The <strong>Langstroth frames</strong> require external inputs(wax foundation) which makes modern beekeeping unsustainable, also wax foundation can carry pesticide residues, which puts the hive at risk.<br> The <strong>Top Bar frames</strong> have an advantage of allowing bees to make their own comb, but the comb is fragile which doesn't lend itself well to inspection or modern honey extraction</p>

<p>The solution is a top bar with a curved bottom bar (steam bent) with wire..<br>it has been shown that bees will embed their comb into wire, giving the comb the stability to be used in a honey extractor. This will render all wax foundation obsolete.</p>

<p>here is a picture of the frame.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.beesource.com/resources/elements-of-beekeeping/alternative-hive-designs/hybrid-top-bar-hive-barry-birkey/05-tbhframe1/" class="onebox" rel="nofollow">http://www.beesource.com/resources/elements-of-beekeeping/alternative-hive-designs/hybrid-top-bar-hive-barry-birkey/05-tbhframe1/</a></p>

<p>has anyone used this design? what were the results?</p>

      <p>That's interesting - thanks for the post - my initial thought is to attempt to get it to work without having pieces that are sourced from outside of the initial sheet of material - can we do this all from one sheet of plywood for instance? </p>

      <p>I use frames without foundation in my Langstroth hives and have been happy with the results. One of the issues with the model you're proposing is that by re-using the wax from season to season (rather than using crush and strain extraction) is that you have the opportunity to build up toxins in the wax. </p>

<p>While honey yields are lower with a destructive model, it is better for the overall health of the hive, which I believe to be more important at this point in the beekeeping world.</p>

      <p>the problem with the 'destructive model' that is usually associated with top bar hive..is that it costs the bees a lot of energy to generate wax( something like 1 lb of wax take 8 lbs of honey to create)..its better to change once every 3-4 years(obviously depending on how toxic your environment is)<br>The problem with the top bar hive is that it doesn't give you the option to keep the wax if you want to. it forces you to destroy the beekeepers most valuable asset: drawn comb....</p>

<p>The advantage of this model over the langstroth frame is that it is easier to build (less intricate parts)...plus if it is CNC milled it wont require steam bending at all...</p>
