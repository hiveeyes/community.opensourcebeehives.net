<p><strong>Design Changes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Starting with the Colorado Top Bar</li>
<li>Remove the hive legs</li>
<li>Lengthen the side walls to nearly 48" - increases hive size for minimal manufacturing time increase.</li>
<li>Remove the roof and use a flat roof design</li>
<li>Change inside profile cuts to use 1/2" bit</li>
<li>Remove the pocket cuts from the sides of the top bars - this is now unnecessary.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Flat Roof</strong></p>

<p><img src="/uploads/default/185/eacf72592fa619e3.png" width="600" height="450"> </p>

<p><strong>Top Bar Change</strong></p>

<p>Let the top bars sit on top of the side walls for easier access.</p>

        <p>Nice - this makes a lot of sense now I see what you're talking about.</p>

<p>Perhaps we don't need an economy version for the Warré, since Economy options lack choice by nature, and a single economy version will keep our workflow more simple. I like how you've got all the top bars on there, but we'll have to look into the roof design, as those purple hives have siding to their roofs.</p>

<p>I'm also observing that the angle looks steeper on our design. We might have to consider widening the base of ours so it remains stable. Heres a little illustration: </p>

        <p>I agree that the legs could be cut out of the deign to lower the price - cinder blocks or a hive stand could be used instead.</p>

<p> The top bars on top of the hive - similar to Phil Chandler's Bio Bees hive - would not only cut cost, but would be easier to work with. </p>

<p>It is hard for me to part with the roof design, Its kind of a signature look that people love...</p>

        <p>We could keep the roof but make it smaller. We have to balance a number of issues. Will it still be cost effective to keep the roof? We have to test it out.</p>

        <p>Sorry - a bit late on the reply regarding the roof design, but I just found this site....</p>

<p>As a beekeeper who would like hardware to last as long as possible, I think a flat roof (preferably covered with a layer of roofing tin) would be better, like the langstroth hive tops.  Not as attractive, but oh well.</p>

<p>Given that this is being made from sheet plywood rather than hardwood lumber, and the fact you don't generally want to put pressure/chemically treated wood next to your bees (or your honey), then a plain plywood roof (or even cypress plywood if you can find it and afford it) would probably not hold up all that long in the weather, even with a coat of exterior latex...</p>

<p>any guestimate when 'final' plans for this lower cost TBH might become available?</p>

        <p>Hi!</p>

<p>regarding the minimum space between the pieces, I usually leave a space 2.5 bigger than the toolbit</p>
