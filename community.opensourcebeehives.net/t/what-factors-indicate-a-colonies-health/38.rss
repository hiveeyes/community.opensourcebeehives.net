    <description>ADVISE, RESEARCH, COMMENT
-------------------------

If you&#39;re a beekeeper, entomologist, or sensor expert, please share any insights you have into what specific factors we can monitor within a beehive to indicate colony health, and why. Links to research papers and other materials are appreciated.</description>

              <p>I know weight monitoring has been mentioned, but I don't see a reference to in this forum.</p>

<p>Tracking the hive weight has several benefits:<br>- monitoring honey and brood weights - sign of a healthy laying queen.<br>- swarm detection/prevention<br>- hive to hive comparisons.</p>

              <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/users/jagungal">@Jagungal</a> we are planning to have temperature and humidity data for inside and outside the hive. These kinds of sensors are low hanging fruit, so count on them being available. We appreciate your novel use case and feedback.</p>

              <p>One of the big problems that we have here in urban areas is heatwaves - while the bees can 'beard' to cool down the hive, on the paved areas where our hives sit we have had significant kills when the tiles become too hot and cook the bees as they touch down, so external temp would be handy to monitor.</p>

<p>The other issue is internal temps - during prolonged heatwaves it tends to overwhelm the hive and you get wax melting inside the hive - very damaging and a bad mess to clean up.  Our hive is that the office, so if there was some sort of warning that the internal temps are getting out of control we can take action by hosing the area down with water.</p>
