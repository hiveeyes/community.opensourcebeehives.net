    <description>see http://www.euse.de/honig/beescale/graph.php
my monitoring prototype uses the weight cell you are proposing [here][1].
the [hive design][2] is from a urban bee keeping community project called &quot;bienenkiste.de&quot;. they re-invented and upgraded the [Krainer Bauernstock][3], a design from an 18th century beekeeping book describing beekeeping techniques in the Balkans. my [data][4] is also downloadable. but sorry, my [how-to][5] and [todo-list][6] are only in German language. i would like to answer translation questions or assist a translation.

my next step will be a temperature sensor matrix inside the hive (7x5x3 sensors in the 60x40x20cm hive breeding space). it will produce plots like [here][7] (i tried to connect to those developers but they didnt answer). i will probably use [heatmap.js][8] to visualize data. my plan is to improve visualization techniques to be able to show an animated semi-transparent 3d-heat plot of the hive - instead of only (animated) 2d-cuts through the hive. hardware-work, electronic circuits and data-transfer and -storage will not be my problem. i need help (or more self-education) when it comes to improving visualization algorithms and coding.

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/ron">@ron</a>: i will check hiveeyes and hivelife.<br>3d-plotting: jpgraph is no alternative because it doesnt produce 3d. it is just another javascript-2d-visualizing-library with a business plan in the back. so i prefere dygraphs for line charts and heatmap.js for 2d-heatmapping.</p>

              <p>For beekeeping with Top Bar Hives (TBH), knowing how the weight distributes between the front (typical cluster and brood area) and the back (honey stores) is important. Thus with a weight bridge having sensors on the corners of the hive you can monitor not just the total weight, but also weight distribution.</p>

              <p>Hey Mark!<br>Yeah while connecting to the hiveeyes project I found your blog and the weight cell setup which looked really promising!</p>

<p>Looking for visualization and coding i have two suggestions for you:<br>1. you could try to contact the guys from hiveeyes.org - they are thinking about that already (though i don't know if they have anyone yet for doing the job)<br>2. We'll be developing a frontend in the next months. It will be open source and probably it should be easy for u to adapt the thing. <a class="mention" href="/users/brianzable">@brianzable</a> is running a project called HiveLife - that might be interesting for you aswell - he said it's easy for him to include external data into his frontend - so maybe he has a solution for you <img src="//community.opensourcebeehives.net/plugins/emoji/images/wink.png" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>concerning the 3d data visualisation, u may have a look into that program:<br><a href="http://jpgraph.net/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://jpgraph.net/</a></p>
