<p><strong>Comparing and Contrasting the Warre Hive with Sweet Valley Hive's</strong></p>

<p><em>Sweet Valley Warre Hive Upgrades</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<em>Bottom Board</em>: incorporated an 8 mesh screen for defense against parasites. At the back, there is a mite board that can be sprayed with cooking spray, where 'groomed mites' from the hive fall and get stuck.</li>
<li>
<em>Quilt Box</em>: a propolis screen with a 1cm frame and 8 mesh wire that prevents the bees from accessing the quilt cloth.</li>
<li>
<em>Queen Ring</em>: a 3cm shim with an opening for the queen cage allowing for a safe way to introduce her to the hive.</li>
<li>
<em>Frames</em>: have frame guides allowing them to be removed and inspected.</li>
<li>
<em>Hive Windows</em>: each box has a window for visual inspection.</li>
<li>
<em>Positive Bee Space</em>: 12mm spacing guides between each frame using cutouts that guarantee proper spacing between frames.</li>

      <p>Here's a link to the original: <a href="http://www.users.callnetuk.com/~heaf/beekeeping_for_all.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.users.callnetuk.com/~heaf/beekeeping_for_all.pdf</a>.<br>It's seems a bit strange when people in this community refer to OSBH's version cut via CNC as the open source Warré hive. It's similar to saying the "wet water".  It's a fork of an open source project that started over 60 years ago!</p>

<p>Abbé Warré created this design for the people along with the philosophy and methods needed to keep bees in it. Note: the last page has the Creative Commons licensing information on it. It's called the people's hive because it was designed to be built with common tools and materials making beekeeping accessible to those without money and machines.</p>

<p>I don't mean to sound like I'm lecturing.  I'm just pointing out OS Warre V1.0 already happened, and it is significantly different than yours by that name.  One of the most important aspects of open source hardware/software is giving credit where credit is due.</p>

      <p>Very good point!  Open source design is nothing new, and this project is really a way to make it easier/cheaper for people to fabricate an updated but already open design...which is a great idea in itself but not really the first open source beehive.  This really should be more explicitly explained (giant shoulders and all that) but doesn't make for a good marketing/crowd-funding strategy.  That said, these hives do look pretty awesome and I can't wait to build one.</p>
