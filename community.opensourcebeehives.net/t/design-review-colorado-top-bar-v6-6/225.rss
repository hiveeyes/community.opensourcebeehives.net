    <description>**Colorado Top Bar v6.6**

To address some functionality issues with the CTB v6.4, @jonathan has made some further changes. This thread intends to review the following changes:

 - **Lowered side walls**: to allow the top bars to sit along the ridge of the side walls, rather than in a pocket cut in the side walls. Allows for easier removal of the bars for checking brood and honey combs (and extracting honey).

 - **Lengthened hive**: to allow top bars to swell and contract with changing humidity and still enable them to be easily removed.

**Prototype Review:**

Generally cut really well - minor issues need to be addressed:

 1. Top bars don&#39;t quite fit between ridges of side walls.
 2. Roof beam is loose in the assembly.
 3. Roof assembly (fully assembled roof) no longer has the support of lowered side wall. As a result the roof no longer sits securely and rocks around on the hive.
