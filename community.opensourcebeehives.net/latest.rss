              <p>I've been using a Raspberry Pi to monitor my hives for a while now. I have a couple of BS18B20's and a DHT22 in each of 2 hives so I was interested to see that's rather similar to what's been done here. I also have a camera looking at one of the hives - I want to try using OpenCV to track traffic but, probably in common with everyone else, I've had too little time so far. I also want to add load cells via a HX711 but, again, this has stalled.</p>

<p>Anyway, I upload the readings via MQTT to IBM's Bluemix PaaS, where the readings are stored, and from where the data are delivered to the web page at <a href="http://beespi.mybluemix.net">BeeSpi</a>. The Bluemix end is programmed using NodeRED. </p>

<p>This monitors the 2 hives in the bottom of my garden where I have power and WiFi. I'd like to make it work for an off-grid location, perhaps by using solar cells and GPRS.</p>

              <p>I am wondering if there are any open source CAM software that would be able to process the open source beehive designs. So far I have only used very basic CAM software at our makerspace to make very simple parts or signs. Creating the full nested 4x8 sheet is proving to be a bit challenging without expensive CAM software. I will have to break the nest into two or possibly 3 sections so that we can cut it on our 5' by 5' shapoko router.</p>

<p>Can anyone give me some advice about how to proceed? What CAM software should I try? Is there an easy way to break down the full design into individual SVG files so that they could be processed using simpler CAM software such as easel?</p>

              <p>Hi there,</p>

<p>I am new here and found out about your project very recently. I was wondering if anyone could export the latest plans to SVG for me. At our makerspace we don’t have access to any commercial CAM software that can import the DXF and converting the DXF to SVG is proving rather difficult. If you could export the parts to SVG from your CAD, that would be very useful to us! I am attempting to use easel to create the gcode. </p>

<p>I have already tried using Inkscape and QCAD to convert the DXF file into SVG. QCAD does a better job, however it still breaks segments of contour into individual path.</p>

              <p>Hi All,<br>I'd like to offer fabrication services for those around the Minneapolis &amp; St. Paul, Minnesota, area. I've just joined the site but have been following it for a few months. I've been interested in beekeeping for several years but haven't been able to get a spot in the highly desirable University of Minnesota extension program for beekeeping. There are just a few classes and they sell out very quickly and we are required to take a course to get a beekeeping permit in the city.</p>

<p>I have a start-up business making wood products using digital fabrication and traditional woodworking methods and am designing for the 4'x8' CNC router and 24"x36" 90W CO2 laser I use. I'd like to be part of the product and be a resource for people who need fabrication services. Finegrain Studios only uses FSC and reclaimed wood as well as timber from my family farm. Finishes are either certified non-toxic commercial products with a preference toward natural oils or my homemade mineral oil and beeswax wood finish...made with the help of Minnesota bees!</p>

<p>Please PM me for more information. My website hasn't yet launched but will in the next month.<br>Andy Fahl<br>Owner, Chief Elf<br>Finegrain Studios, Ltd.<br>finegrainstudios.com</p>

              <p>I noticed that there are several versions of a V6 design for the Colorado Top Bar (which I will be making). The manual is for the 5.4 version.</p>

<p>At first glance it looks a bit puzzling which version I should be building. Could there be a stickie referencing the latest prefered design files and manual?</p>

<p>Simply put there can be many design iterations and fine tuning before the design is useful and standardised for "production" and it might be useful for casual or first time browsers to have simple links to the current best design, updated manual and example pictures.</p>

              <p>Hi, im new here, But love the effort thats been put into the beehive designs in true opensource style, and growing the bee keeper community, So i thought i would join the effort. </p>

<p>Because i router all parts from 3d when there are 3d strategies involved. I have layed all the parts from the 3d Barcelona_Warre_Hive into a parasolid x_t Nested into an 8x4 sheet in the same layout as the original, If of use to anyone, (parasolid text file is version 27, if anyone requires an earlier version or different 3d format please contact me and i will be happy to re format) </p>

<p>If anyone here is looking for cnc flat packs of these in the uk.. I can cut these for £100. Please enquire via my website: <a href="http://www.southwestcnc.co.uk" rel="nofollow">www.southwestcnc.co.uk</a></p>

              <p><strong>Colorado Top Bar v6.6</strong></p>

<p>To address some functionality issues with the CTB v6.4, <a class="mention" href="/users/jonathan">@jonathan</a> has made some further changes. This thread intends to review the following changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lowered side walls</strong>: to allow the top bars to sit along the ridge of the side walls, rather than in a pocket cut in the side walls. Allows for easier removal of the bars for checking brood and honey combs (and extracting honey).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lengthened hive</strong>: to allow top bars to swell and contract with changing humidity and still enable them to be easily removed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prototype Review:</strong></p>

<p>Generally cut really well - minor issues need to be addressed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Top bars don't quite fit between ridges of side walls.</li>
<li>Roof beam is loose in the assembly.</li>
<li>Roof assembly (fully assembled roof) no longer has the support of lowered side wall. As a result the roof no longer sits securely and rocks around on the hive.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm setting up an APRS station this winter and attaching it to my weather sensor rig.  As I'm fussing with all this, I started thinking, can I make a beehive-scale APRS station?   Or maybe have multiple hosts operating on QRP frequencies with a line-of-sight between the hives and the base/collection station.</p>

<p>Anyone else thought about using QRP or Part 15 compliant networks for getting data back to home?</p>

<p>A couple of my mates went to the launch, and this is real, not a trick.  Due to the temperature in-hive the honey apparently drains out surprisingly fast.  </p>

<p>my next step will be a temperature sensor matrix inside the hive (7x5x3 sensors in the 60x40x20cm hive breeding space). it will produce plots like [here][7] (i tried to connect to those developers but they didnt answer). i will probably use [heatmap.js][8] to visualize data. my plan is to improve visualization techniques to be able to show an animated semi-transparent 3d-heat plot of the hive - instead of only (animated) 2d-cuts through the hive. hardware-work, electronic circuits and data-transfer and -storage will not be my problem. i need help (or more self-education) when it comes to improving visualization algorithms and coding.</p>

<p>Here's a small introduction to it.

<p>The manual <a href="https://hivelife.co/">HiveLife data entry app</a> and the OSBH sensor kit may benefit from exchanging data, possibly to inform an OSBH data algorithm. The intended result of this would be to teach the OSBH algorithm how to detect more subtle variations in the hive via manual data entry by HiveLife app users.</p>
