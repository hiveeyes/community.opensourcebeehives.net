              <p>I've been using a Raspberry Pi to monitor my hives for a while now. I have a couple of BS18B20's and a DHT22 in each of 2 hives so I was interested to see that's rather similar to what's been done here. I also have a camera looking at one of the hives - I want to try using OpenCV to track traffic but, probably in common with everyone else, I've had too little time so far. I also want to add load cells via a HX711 but, again, this has stalled.</p>

<p>Anyway, I upload the readings via MQTT to IBM's Bluemix PaaS, where the readings are stored, and from where the data are delivered to the web page at <a href="http://beespi.mybluemix.net">BeeSpi</a>. The Bluemix end is programmed using NodeRED. </p>

<p>This monitors the 2 hives in the bottom of my garden where I have power and WiFi. I'd like to make it work for an off-grid location, perhaps by using solar cells and GPRS.</p>

              <p>Caveat:  in the US you need an amateur radio (ham) license to go down this route.</p>

<p>I'm setting up an APRS station this winter and attaching it to my weather sensor rig.  As I'm fussing with all this, I started thinking, can I make a beehive-scale APRS station?   Or maybe have multiple hosts operating on QRP frequencies with a line-of-sight between the hives and the base/collection station.</p>

<p>Anyone else thought about using QRP or Part 15 compliant networks for getting data back to home?</p>

              <p>I wonder if anyone can explain the OSBH project goals to me because I feel like I don't get it any more. Few months ago when I found this project on the Internet I was really excited with the idea of solving the CCD problem using the community driven way. I myself am not a beekeeper. Actually I'm a software developer but I'm aware of the problem and kind of apprehensive because of it. I just want to ask you a few questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>What are the actual project goals?</li>
<li>What are the project goals in terms of scale?</li>
<li>Do you plan to involve professional beekepers?</li>
<li>What is your view on the diy'ers participation in terms of data quality? To train an algorithm your data must be reliable but it will be not when collected by different devices you actually know nothing about. It is not a problem when participants are few but when going into large scale there will be significant data pollution obfuscating the picture.</li>
<li>How do you plan to analyze the collected data?</li>
<li>Is there any kind of a plan or road map for the project? Where can I find it to check if there are any greenfield or support needing areas to participate?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance,<br>Jakub</p>
