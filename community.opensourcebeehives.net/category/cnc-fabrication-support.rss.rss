              <p>I am wondering if there are any open source CAM software that would be able to process the open source beehive designs. So far I have only used very basic CAM software at our makerspace to make very simple parts or signs. Creating the full nested 4x8 sheet is proving to be a bit challenging without expensive CAM software. I will have to break the nest into two or possibly 3 sections so that we can cut it on our 5' by 5' shapoko router.</p>

<p>Can anyone give me some advice about how to proceed? What CAM software should I try? Is there an easy way to break down the full design into individual SVG files so that they could be processed using simpler CAM software such as easel?</p>

              <p>Hi there,</p>

<p>I am new here and found out about your project very recently. I was wondering if anyone could export the latest plans to SVG for me. At our makerspace we donâ€™t have access to any commercial CAM software that can import the DXF and converting the DXF to SVG is proving rather difficult. If you could export the parts to SVG from your CAD, that would be very useful to us! I am attempting to use easel to create the gcode. </p>

<p>I have already tried using Inkscape and QCAD to convert the DXF file into SVG. QCAD does a better job, however it still breaks segments of contour into individual path.</p>

              <p>Hi All,<br>I'd like to offer fabrication services for those around the Minneapolis &amp; St. Paul, Minnesota, area. I've just joined the site but have been following it for a few months. I've been interested in beekeeping for several years but haven't been able to get a spot in the highly desirable University of Minnesota extension program for beekeeping. There are just a few classes and they sell out very quickly and we are required to take a course to get a beekeeping permit in the city.</p>

<p>I have a start-up business making wood products using digital fabrication and traditional woodworking methods and am designing for the 4'x8' CNC router and 24"x36" 90W CO2 laser I use. I'd like to be part of the product and be a resource for people who need fabrication services. Finegrain Studios only uses FSC and reclaimed wood as well as timber from my family farm. Finishes are either certified non-toxic commercial products with a preference toward natural oils or my homemade mineral oil and beeswax wood finish...made with the help of Minnesota bees!</p>

<p>Please PM me for more information. My website hasn't yet launched but will in the next month.<br>Andy Fahl<br>Owner, Chief Elf<br>Finegrain Studios, Ltd.<br>finegrainstudios.com</p>

<p>However, the top bars don't seem to rest as easily on the hive as they did in the older designs and the shape of the bars seems to be inverted from earlier designs. Here's what they look like:<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a href="//community.opensourcebeehives.net/uploads/default/281/06447b0d470887e5.JPG" class="lightbox" title="IMG_7348.JPG"><img src="//community.opensourcebeehives.net/uploads/default/_optimized/a83/498/9d39f5428c_375x500.JPG" width="375" height="500"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div> </p>

<p>Did I do something wrong? Did I misread the 5mm pocket layer or is this correct?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Because i router all parts from 3d when there are 3d strategies involved. I have layed all the parts from the 3d Barcelona_Warre_Hive into a parasolid x_t Nested into an 8x4 sheet in the same layout as the original, If of use to anyone, (parasolid text file is version 27, if anyone requires an earlier version or different 3d format please contact me and i will be happy to re format) </p>

              <p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>I've reached out to a CNC shop that is willing to help cut the hives for me, however, they are requesting the dimensions in the files be in inches instead of metric. Apparently their machines will only work in inches and they would prefer not to do the rounding. They used a 5mm deep pocketing operation as an example. Does that translate to 0.196 or 0.2 inches?</p>

<p>The reason I'm posting here is for advice on how to approach this. Has someone run into this problem before? I'm happy to attempt to convert the current source files to inches, but it would be helpful to know what type of accuracy is required to make this work.</p>

              <p>Hey, y'all! </p>

<p>First, I've just got to say how great this site and the designs are. Absolutely love what you're doing -- keep up the great work!</p>

<p>Second, I was wondering what type of software y'all (and other forum members) use to create your designs. Is it the same program for the 3D, CAD, and expanded/blown-apart views? Done graphic design for years, but just getting into attempting 3d modeling and CAD.</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance for any info or recs!</p>

<p>I made this quick screencast - turn off the audio (I'll do that next time) and play in HD and at 2x speed.</p>

<p>Am I making pockets in the optimal way?</p>

              <p>Why not create a database of all known shops that can create these designs in house?<br>Things to possibly list;</p>

<ol>
<li>Name of shop</li>
<li>General/Specific region, address</li>
<li>Contact Name</li>
<li>Cost for service(setup fee, material fees, other fees)</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea here is to manufacture close to home as to keep costs down, as well as environmental impact.<br>Any suggestions welcome.</p>
