              <p>I am Yuichi, a beekeeper from Japan, and I live in San Francisco now.</p>

<p>I released an iPhone app for beekeepers. It is social networking app for beekeeper and allows you to communicate with beekeepers all over the world.</p>

<p>It would be great if you could install this app and try it. You can log in by using your Facebook Account.</p>

<p>You may wonder why I developed this app. I am working for a technology company as a Engineer, so I can develop apps by myself.My parents keep bees in Japan and I had kept them too in Japan.</p>

<p>This app is completely free and there are no ad. I would like many people to enjoy beekeeping more.<br>If many people like it, I would like to develop Android version.</p>

<p>And eventually, I wanna support Open Source Beehives in the future. </p>

<p>You can download this app on App store.</p>

<p>App Store (Free download)<br><aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">

<p>And I have the landing page for this app.<br>Landing page<br><a href="http://www.beehive-app.net/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.beehive-app.net/</a></p>

<p>If would be great if you could introducde this app and share this app with your friends.<br>If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!</p>

              <p>Hi everyone.</p>

<p>Bees are ordered and I plan to cut a Colorado top bar soon. I've offered to be a alpha tester for the sensor kit.</p>

<p>I'm a developer by trade- so I'm interested in helping with the software app.</p>

<p>How can I get started helping with the software app?</p>

<p>thanks</p>

          <title>Hivelife - software for manual hive observations</title>

              <p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>I'm here to post about a project I've been working on called Hivelife. The project is a web application that shares a similar philosophy to the OSBH project. The goal of Hivelife is to create a free tool for beekeepers to record their observations from beehive inspections. The data from these inspections is then anonymized according to user settings and made available for the public. I started working on this as an academic project and have since then taken it down to focus on redesigning it. In the future, I'd like to also develop mobile applications that make data collection in the field easier. Right now, the focus is to make a polished web application so that everyone with a web browser can add data. I'd also like to explore ways to integrate Hivelife with the OSBH sensors kits. I believe this would make it a very powerful tool in that it would be able to record data from both sensors and human observation.</p>

<p>Right now you can visit the site at <a href="https://hivelife.co/" rel="nofollow">https://hivelife.co/</a> - its just a single page with a little bit of information at the moment, but in the coming weeks there will be a blog containing development updates. If anyone has any questions, thoughts, or comments, I'd love to hear them! I hope to have a working beta of the site ready by the beginning of the next beekeeping season in the US!</p>
